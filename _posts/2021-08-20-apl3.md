I analyzed moral foundations from text using a BERT model while working at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory. The text was categorized into the six moral foundations as described [here](https://moralfoundations.org/).

I also developed a Siamese network to extrapolate the moral foundations from text.

Both tasks required me to extensively refactor the existing BERT code for usability.
