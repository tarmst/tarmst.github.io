As a part of undergraduate research with Dr. Sahil Shah, I am  developing a spiking network for object detection. Currently, I am building and comparing several networks for
object detection including single shot multibox detectors and encoder-decoder models using spiking convolutional networks. 

This project aims to develop a spiking neural network for object detection on event data, allowing object detection in
scenarios with low power constraints, such as implantable devices and wearables. Once built, these networks may be deployed in biomedical devices in the future.
