While at JHU APL, I created transformer-based machine learning model for anomalous network traffic detection that yielded significantly higher accuracy than previous LSTM-based models.

I also deployed the machine learning models for anomalous network traffic detection to sponsor networks. I was responsible for troubleshooting software & the deployment to the sponsor network.

Additionally, I developed social media malware trend analysis by utilizing social media APIs to proactively identify specific malware likely to be in use.
