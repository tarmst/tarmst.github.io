This project aims to develop a spiking neural network for object detection on event data, allowing object detection in
scenarios with low power constraints, such as implantable devices and wearables. 

I am contributing to the project by developing a spiking network for object detection. I am currently building and comparing several networks for
object detection including single shot multibox detectors and encoder-decoder models using spiking convolutional networks. 

Once built, these networks may be deployed in biomedical devices in the future.
