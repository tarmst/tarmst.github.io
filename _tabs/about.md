I'm a senior at the University of Maryland College Park majoring in computer science with a specialization in machine learning. I also have a strong background in statistics and cybersecurity. I'm interested in research with large language models and their applications to simulate human behavior. I have been interning at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory for the past 5 years where I am an author of intellectual property bringing deep learning to network traffic analysis.

<br/>
Current Undergraduate Research:
 - Large language models for hyper-targeted phishing attacks
 - Spiking neural networks for object detection in low power scenarios

<br/>
In my free time, I enjoy playing the double bass, learning new languages, and rock climbing.
