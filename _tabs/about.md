I'm a junior at the University of Maryland College Park majoring in computer science with a specialization in machine learning. I also have a strong background in statistics and cybersecurity. I'm interested in research with large language models and their applications to simulate human behavior.

In my free time, I enjoy playing the double bass, learning new languages, and playing video games.

Currently, I'm working on undergraduate research ensuring the polyphase properties of vision transformers. I'm also interning at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory where I am an author of a patent involving bringing deep learning to network traffic analysis.
